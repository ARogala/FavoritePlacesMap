## About

My Favorite Places Map was built for Udacity's Front End Nano-degree program. This app features a filterable list containing some of my favorite locations. Each location is displayed as a marker on a map, and clicking the marker displays an information window about the location. Each information window contains a link the locations foursquare page, a link to search the location on google maps, the locations address, and a street view of the location.
